This project aims to transform standard light bulbs into smart bulbs using an ESP32 and an online hub for remote control. Through a Wi-Fi connection, the system allows you to turn the lights on and off, adjust brightness, and even set schedules for automated control, providing greater convenience and energy efficiency.
