# Project: Transforming Standard Light Bulbs into Smart Bulbs with ESP32 and an Online Hub
## Project description:
This project aims to transform standard light bulbs into smart bulbs using an ESP32 and an online hub for remote control. Through a Wi-Fi connection, the system allows you to turn the lights on and off, adjust brightness, and even set schedules for automated control, providing greater convenience and energy efficiency.

Features:
- Remote Control: Turn the lights on/off from anywhere via a web interface or mobile app.

- Brightness Adjustment: Easily control the light intensity of the bulbs.

- Automation: Set rules and schedules to turn the lights on/off automatically.

- Online Hub Integration: The ESP32 connects to a server for centralized control and easy access via browser or app.

Technologies Used:
- ESP32: Microcontroller for controlling the bulbs and communicating with the online hub.

- Web Server: For managing and controlling the bulbs through a graphical interface.

- Wi-Fi: Wireless communication between the ESP32 and the central server.

This project provides an excellent solution for modernizing home or office lighting without the need to replace bulbs with expensive smart models.
